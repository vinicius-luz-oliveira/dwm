# dwm
My dwm build. Really novice one, I`m still working on it. Basically just a bunch of patches and keybinds.

## Requirements
* All the colors used in this build use pywal, a tool written in python to get a color pallet and apply it on your system. There is already a patch that takes the xrdb colors and apply it to dwm but I find pywal`s versatility and speed to grab new color schemes really useful and fun.
